# Task Specification: Enhanced Production-Ready TeamOps MCP Server Implementation

## LLM Instruction Prompt

> **For AI Agents:** You are implementing a production-ready TypeScript MCP server that automates TeamOps workflow orchestration while building scalable architecture from day 1.
> 
> 1. **Architecture First**: Build abstractions early, implement MVP versions that scale to production without rewrites
> 2. **Phase-Based Development**: Focus on foundation, orchestration, multi-feature capability, then validation
> 3. **Provider Abstraction**: Design unified AI provider interface (Claude Code first, others later)
> 4. **Configuration-Driven**: YAML-based architecture enabling production deployment with environment overrides
> 5. **Event System Foundation**: Telemetry and monitoring hooks built-in from day 1
> 6. **Git Integration**: Create `mcp-server/` directory in current feature/tmops-mcp branch
> 7. **Reuse Existing**: Leverage proven tmops_v6_portable shell scripts and patterns
> 8. **Manual Fallback**: Maintain ability to revert to manual orchestration at all phases
> 9. **Security First**: Implement comprehensive input validation and process isolation
> 10. **Research-Driven**: Validate MCP SDK patterns, TypeScript best practices, Node.js production patterns

## Context

### Problem Statement
TeamOps framework requires manual coordination between Claude Code instances, creating handoff latency (5-10 min → <10 sec target) and limiting scalability to single-feature development. Current manual workflow has 95% context coherence and 99% success rate but cannot scale for production use.

### Background
- TeamOps v6 provides proven 4-instance TDD workflow (Orchestrator → Tester → Implementer → Verifier)
- Existing shell scripts in `tmops_v6_portable/tmops_tools/` handle feature initialization and coordination
- Checkpoint system uses filesystem markers in `.tmops/[feature]/runs/initial/checkpoints/`
- Manual handoffs ensure quality but limit adoption and concurrent feature development
- MCP protocol provides standardized AI tool integration with production-ready foundations
- Production deployment needed after MVP validation with multi-tenant scaling capability

- Existing Framework: `tmops_v6_portable/`

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: Use Provider Pattern for AI Abstraction
- **Status**: Approved
- **Context**: Need to support multiple AI providers (Claude Code, OpenAI, Anthropic) without core system changes
- **Decision**: Implement AIProvider interface with factory pattern for provider selection
- **Rationale**: 
  - Enables vendor flexibility and reduces lock-in risk
  - Supports configuration-driven provider switching
  - Maintains consistent session management across providers
- **Consequences**: 
  - Positive: Easy to add new AI providers, testable through mocks
  - Negative: Additional abstraction layer complexity
  - Mitigation: Start with single provider, expand incrementally

### ADR-002: Plugin-Based Phase System for Extensibility
- **Status**: Approved  
- **Context**: TeamOps workflows may need custom phases beyond standard 4-phase model
- **Decision**: Implement OrchestrationPhase interface with plugin registry
- **Rationale**: 
  - Supports custom workflows and specialized development processes
  - Maintains extensibility without modifying core orchestration engine
  - Enables validation and rollback capabilities per phase
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Flexible workflow customization, maintainable extensions
  - Negative: Increased initial complexity, plugin management overhead
  - Mitigation: Ship with 4 standard phases, document plugin development

### ADR-003: Configuration-Driven Architecture
- **Status**: Approved
- **Context**: Production deployment requires environment-specific settings without code changes
- **Decision**: YAML-based configuration with environment variable support
- **Rationale**:
  - Enables production deployment without code modifications
  - Supports multi-tenant workspace configuration
  - Provides clear separation of configuration and implementation
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Production-ready deployment, environment flexibility
  - Negative: Configuration validation complexity, startup dependencies
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive schema validation, fallback defaults

## Scope

### In Scope
- [ ] TypeScript MCP server with production architecture foundations
- [ ] AI provider abstraction layer (Claude Code implementation + interface for others)
- [ ] Configuration-driven architecture with YAML config system and environment overrides
- [ ] Plugin-based phase system (4 standard phases: orchestrator, tester, implementer, verifier)
- [ ] Event system foundation with telemetry hooks (console/file outputs in MVP)
- [ ] Checkpoint monitoring and automated phase transitions with error recovery
- [ ] Multi-tenant architecture foundation (single tenant implementation with scaling hooks)
- [ ] Error recovery with comprehensive rollback capabilities and manual fallback
- [ ] Resource isolation between concurrent features
- [ ] Git branch integration within current feature/tmops-mcp branch
- [ ] Comprehensive security controls and input validation
- [ ] Production deployment documentation and monitoring foundation

### Out of Scope
- [ ] Web dashboard UI (future enhancement - event system provides foundation)
- [ ] Multiple AI provider implementations beyond Claude Code (architecture only)
- [ ] Advanced authentication beyond configuration-based API keys (hooks in place)
- [ ] Performance optimization beyond basic requirements and benchmarking
- [ ] Complex retry/circuit breaker patterns (basic error recovery included)

### MVP Definition
Working MCP server that can orchestrate a complete feature development workflow end-to-end with production-ready architecture patterns, comprehensive error handling, and deployment-ready configuration system in `mcp-server/` subdirectory.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **[REQ-1]** MCP server MUST implement standard MCP protocol using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk with full tool registry
- **[REQ-2]** System MUST provide `tmops_init_feature` tool that wraps `./tmops_v6_portable/tmops_tools/init_feature_multi.sh` with input validation
- **[REQ-3]** System MUST provide `tmops_start_orchestration` tool for automated workflow with session management
- **[REQ-4]** System MUST provide `tmops_get_status` tool for real-time workflow monitoring with detailed phase information
- **[REQ-5]** System MUST monitor `.tmops/[feature]/runs/initial/checkpoints/` for phase transitions with file validation
- **[REQ-6]** System MUST support AI provider abstraction through common interface with factory pattern
- **[REQ-7]** System MUST implement configuration-driven architecture with YAML config and environment variable support
- **[REQ-8]** System MUST emit structured telemetry events for all workflow operations with configurable backends
- **[REQ-9]** System MUST maintain manual fallback capability at all phases with clear override mechanisms
- **[REQ-10]** System SHOULD support concurrent feature development with complete resource isolation

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: MCP tool responses MUST be < 100ms for 95th percentile operations
- **Reliability**: Workflow success rate MUST maintain 95%+ (current manual: 99%) with graceful degradation
- **Scalability**: Architecture MUST support production deployment without rewrites, multi-tenant ready
- **Maintainability**: Plugin architecture MUST allow custom phases without core changes
- **Security**: MUST implement secure checkpoint file handling, input validation, and process isolation
- **Observability**: MUST provide structured logging, metrics collection, and error reporting suitable for production monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: Initialize feature via MCP with comprehensive validation
  Given an MCP server is running with TeamOps configuration loaded
  When Claude Code invokes tmops_init_feature with feature name "test-auth"
  Then the system validates input against security schema
  And the system executes ./tmops_v6_portable/tmops_tools/init_feature_multi.sh test-auth
  And creates feature branch and .tmops directory structure with proper permissions
  And returns success response with next steps and configuration details
  And emits structured telemetry event for feature initialization with timing metrics
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Automated workflow orchestration with error recovery
  Given a feature "test-auth" has been initialized successfully
  When Claude Code invokes tmops_start_orchestration
  Then the system validates feature exists and is in valid state
  And the system spawns orchestrator Claude session with role instructions via provider abstraction
  And monitors checkpoints for phase transitions with file validation
  And automatically triggers tester phase when orchestrator completes and checkpoint is valid
  And continues through implementer and verifier phases sequentially
  And handles any session failures gracefully with automatic recovery
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Concurrent feature isolation with resource management
  Given two features "auth-api" and "user-profile" are active simultaneously
  When both features are in implementation phase at the same time
  Then each feature maintains completely separate state and checkpoints
  And changes to one feature do not affect the other feature's workflow
  And resource isolation prevents any cross-feature interference
  And system respects configured concurrent feature limits
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Manual fallback capability with state preservation
  Given a feature workflow is in any orchestration phase
  When automation encounters an unrecoverable error or is manually disabled
  Then the system provides clear manual override capability
  And existing tmops_v6_portable tools continue to work unchanged
  And manual coordination can resume from current checkpoint with full context
  And automated state is preserved for potential resumption
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Provider abstraction enables configuration-driven switching
  Given MCP server is configured with Claude Code provider
  When system needs to create AI session for orchestration
  Then provider factory creates Claude Code session via abstraction layer
  And session management is completely abstracted from core orchestration logic
  And switching to different providers requires only configuration change
  And provider interface supports all required session management operations
```

## LLM Execution Guidelines (Enhanced)

### Autonomy Level
`constrained` - Implement within defined architecture patterns with comprehensive validation and security requirements

### Repository Access (Detailed Permissions)
**Read Paths:**
- `tmops_v6_portable/` (existing framework to be wrapped - read-only analysis)
- `.tmops/tmops-mcp/` (current feature workspace including research and documentation)
- Root project files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.) for integration patterns
- Existing codebase patterns for consistency validation

**Write Paths:**  
- `mcp-server/` (complete new implementation including all subdirectories)
- `.tmops/tmops-mcp/docs/` (documentation updates and enhancement)
- Test files, configuration files, and development scripts
- Build artifacts and generated documentation

**Restricted Paths:**
- DO NOT modify any files in `tmops_v6_portable/` - this is the existing framework
- DO NOT modify git configuration or project root configuration files
- DO NOT create files outside the designated mcp-server/ directory structure

### Implementation Constraints (Production Requirements)
- **Framework Integration**: Use existing shell scripts via secure subprocess calls, never reimplement functionality
