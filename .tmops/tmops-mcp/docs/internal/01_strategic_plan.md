## AI Planning Instructions

> **For AI Agents:** You are creating a strategic project plan to transform the TeamOps manual AI orchestration framework into an automated MCP server.
> 
> 1. **Synthesize Inputs**: Use research findings on MCP protocol capabilities and context isolation requirements
> 2. **Break Down Work**: Create WBS preserving core TeamOps benefits while adding automation
> 3. **Estimate Realistically**: Use evidence-based estimates from MCP server development patterns
> 4. **Identify Dependencies**: Map critical path through MCP protocol learning curve
> 5. **Resource Planning**: Match TypeScript/MCP skills to automation tasks

> 7. **Depth Control**: Deep profile - comprehensive implementation with multiple scenarios
> 8. **Success Metrics**: Define measurable orchestration and quality outcomes

## Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
Transform TeamOps from a manual AI orchestration framework into an automated MCP server that preserves context isolation and TDD benefits while eliminating coordination overhead and enabling multi-project scalability.

### Strategic Objectives
1. **Objective**: Automate TeamOps orchestration while preserving 95% context quality
   - **Key Result**: Sub-10-second handoff latency vs current 5-10 minute manual coordination
2. **Objective**: Enable multi-project concurrent feature development
   - **Key Result**: Support 5+ simultaneous features across different projects
3. **Objective**: Maintain TDD enforcement and role specialization benefits
   - **Key Result**: 100% test-before-implementation compliance in automated workflows

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Orchestration Speed | 5-10 min/handoff | <10 sec/handoff | MCP tool call latency |
| Context Quality | 95% coherence | 95% coherence | Automated quality assessment |
| Concurrent Features | 1 feature | 5+ features | Active workflow tracking |
| TDD Compliance | 100% (manual) | 100% (automated) | Test-first validation |
| Error Recovery | Manual intervention | 95% auto-recovery | Retry success rate |
