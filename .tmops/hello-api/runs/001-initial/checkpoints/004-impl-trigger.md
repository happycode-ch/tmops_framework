**From:** Orchestrator
**To:** Implementer
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-20 09:34:30
**Feature:** hello-api
**Run:** 001-initial

## Test Summary from Tester
- Tests written: 18 total tests
- Test location: PROJECT/test/hello_api.test.js
- All tests currently failing (as expected)
- Full coverage of acceptance criteria achieved

## Implementation Requirements
Based on the failing tests, implement:
1. HTTP server with `/api/hello` endpoint
2. GET method returns JSON: `{"message": "Hello, World!", "timestamp": "<ISO-8601>"}`
3. 200 status code for successful GET requests
4. Content-Type: application/json header
5. 405 Method Not Allowed for non-GET methods
6. Proper error handling with consistent JSON format
7. Code location: PROJECT/src/

## Technical Notes
- Tests expect server on port 3000
- Timestamp must be ISO-8601 format
- Error responses should be JSON formatted
- All 18 tests must pass

## Action Required
Implementer: Begin implementation phase
- Pull latest code to get test files
- Read test specifications from test/hello_api.test.js
- Write implementation in src/ directory
- Run tests iteratively until all pass
- Commit when complete

## Expected Response
005-impl-complete.md when all tests are passing
