## Work Completed
- Test files created: 2
- Total tests written: 18
- All tests failing: CONFIRMED (17 connection failures, 1 placeholder)
- Coverage of acceptance criteria: 100%
- Test location: PROJECT/test/

## Test Files Created

✅ Response has 200 status code
✅ Content-Type header is application/json  
✅ Handle non-GET methods with 405 Method Not Allowed
✅ Include proper error handling for edge cases
✅ Tests ready for >80% code coverage measurement

### Additional Test Coverage:
- ISO-8601 timestamp format validation
- JSON structure validation
- Fresh timestamp on each request
- 404 error handling for wrong paths
- Consistent error response format

## Git Commit
e306184: test: add failing tests for hello-api endpoint (TDD)

## Next Action
Implementer: Make all tests pass by writing code in src/

## Notes
All tests are currently failing with ECONNREFUSED as expected (no server running). This confirms proper TDD approach - tests written before implementation.
