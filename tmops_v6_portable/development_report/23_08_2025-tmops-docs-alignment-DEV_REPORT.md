# TeamOps Documentation Alignment Development Report

**Date:** 2025-08-23  
**Issue:** Documentation misalignment with current TeamOps v6 Portable implementation  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** Analysis Complete - Fixes Required

## Executive Summary

The TeamOps v6 Portable documentation in `tmops_v6_portable/docs/tmops_docs_v6/` is significantly misaligned with the current system implementation. The main issue is that documentation still references the obsolete worktree-based architecture that was removed in recent commits. This report details all misalignments found and provides specific recommendations for fixes.

## Key Findings

### 1. Major Architecture Change Not Reflected
- **Commit 54a3db1** (2025-08-22): "feat: remove worktrees entirely - TeamOps v6.2 Simplified Edition"
- **Commit c182382** (2025-08-22): "refactor: simplify TeamOps v6 portable to production-ready state"

These commits fundamentally changed the architecture from worktree-based to simple branch-based, but the documentation still extensively references worktrees.

### 2. Version Inconsistencies
- `tmops_claude_code.md`: References v6.0.0-manual
- `tmops_claude_chat.md`: References v5.2.0 and v6.0.0-manual
- `tmops_protocol.md`: References v6.0.0-manual
- `README.md`: Correctly reflects v6.2 Simplified Edition
- `instance_instructions/`: Correctly updated for simplified architecture

### 3. Current System Reality
Based on analysis of code and recent commits:
- **NO worktrees** - All instances work in root directory
- **Single feature branch** - `feature/<name>` shared by all instances
- **Sequential workflow** - One instance works at a time
- **Manual coordination** - Human relays messages between instances
- **Simplified setup** - No complex navigation or directory switching

## Document-Specific Issues and Fixes

### A. tmops_claude_code.md (CRITICAL - HIGHEST PRIORITY)

#### Major Issues:
1. **Lines 13-21**: References worktree directories that no longer exist
2. **Lines 40-43**: Git worktree structure diagram is obsolete
3. **Lines 44-83**: Orchestrator workflow references `wt-orchestrator/`
4. **Lines 108-154**: Tester section references `wt-tester/`
5. **Lines 189-232**: Implementer references `wt-impl/`
6. **Lines 274-316**: Verifier references `wt-verify/`
7. **Lines 381-411**: File structure shows worktrees
8. **Lines 416-443**: Instance identification uses worktree paths
9. **Throughout**: References to "Branch-Per-Role" architecture

#### Required Changes:

**1. Update Instance Identification (Lines 13-21)**
```markdown
## You Are ONE of FOUR Instances

All instances work in the ROOT project directory.
Determine which instance you are based on the instructions you receive:
- Received 01_orchestrator.md → You are the ORCHESTRATOR
- Received 02_tester.md → You are the TESTER  
- Received 03_implementer.md → You are the IMPLEMENTER
- Received 04_verifier.md → You are the VERIFIER

Each instance has a specific role and CANNOT do the work of other instances.
All instances work on the same feature branch: feature/<name>
```

**2. Update Version and Remove v6.0 References**
```markdown
**Version:** 6.2.0-simplified
```

**3. Update Orchestrator Section (Lines 44-83)**
```markdown
## Instance 1: ORCHESTRATOR Role

### Working in Root Directory
```markdown
## Your Identity
You are the ORCHESTRATOR instance coordinating 3 other instances.
You work in the root project directory on branch feature/<name>.

## Your Workflow (Manual v6.2 Simplified)
1. Report: "[ORCHESTRATOR] WAITING: Ready for instructions"
2. WAIT for human: "[BEGIN]: Start orchestration for <feature>"
3. Verify on correct branch: git branch --show-current
4. Initialize logging to .tmops/<feature>/runs/current/logs/orchestrator.log
...
```

**4. Update File Structure (Lines 381-411)**
```markdown
## File Structure (v6.2 Simplified)

### Project Structure
```
project-root/                 # All instances work here
├── .tmops/<feature>/        # TeamOps orchestration files
│   └── runs/current/
│       ├── TASK_SPEC.md
│       ├── checkpoints/
│       ├── logs/
│       └── metrics.json
├── src/                     # Implementation code
├── test/ or tests/          # Test files
└── tmops_v6_portable/       # Framework tools
    ├── tmops_tools/
    └── instance_instructions/
```

**5. Remove All Worktree Navigation Instructions**
- Remove all mentions of `cd wt-*` commands
- Remove navigation complexity warnings
- Update to emphasize single directory operation

### B. tmops_protocol.md (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### Issues:
1. **Lines 86-88**: References `wt-orchestrator`
2. **Throughout**: Version should be 6.2.0-simplified
3. Architecture diagrams show worktrees

#### Required Changes:

**1. Update Version**
```markdown
**Version:** 6.2.0-simplified
```

**2. Update Instance Headers**
```markdown
### 1. Orchestrator Instance (Root Directory - feature/<name> branch)
### 2. Tester Instance (Root Directory - feature/<name> branch)
### 3. Implementer Instance (Root Directory - feature/<name> branch)
### 4. Verifier Instance (Root Directory - feature/<name> branch)
```

### C. tmops_claude_chat.md (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### Issues:
1. **Line 2**: Shows v6.0.0-manual
2. **Line 9**: References v5.2.0
3. Version history sections are confusing

#### Required Changes:

**1. Update Version and Remove Legacy References**
```markdown
**Version:** 6.2.0-simplified
```

**2. Update "What's New" Section**
```markdown
## What's New in v6.2 Simplified

### Complete Simplification
- Removed all Git worktree complexity
- All instances work in root directory
- Single feature branch architecture
- No navigation confusion possible
- Setup time reduced to seconds

### Preserved Benefits
- Full TDD orchestration workflow
- Manual coordination for reliability
- Checkpoint-based progress tracking
- Comprehensive metrics and logging
```

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Critical Documentation Updates
1. **Update tmops_claude_code.md** - Remove all worktree references
2. **Test with dry run** - Verify instructions work correctly

### Phase 2: Supporting Documentation
3. **Update tmops_protocol.md** - Align architecture descriptions
4. **Update tmops_claude_chat.md** - Fix version references

### Phase 3: Validation
5. **Cross-reference all documents** - Ensure consistency
6. **Test complete workflow** - Run through full feature development

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Version Standardization
Adopt consistent version numbering:
- Current version: **6.2.0-simplified**
- Remove all references to v5.x, v6.0, v6.1

### 2. Documentation Structure
Consider consolidating:
- Merge overlapping content between files
- Create single source of truth for architecture
- Move instance instructions to be the primary reference

### 3. Automated Validation
Create script to validate documentation consistency:
- Check for worktree references
- Verify version numbers match
- Ensure file paths are correct

## Impact Assessment

### Current Impact
- **User Confusion**: HIGH - Instructions don't match reality
- **Setup Failures**: MEDIUM - Users may try to create worktrees
- **Workflow Errors**: HIGH - Navigation instructions are wrong

### Post-Fix Benefits
- **Clarity**: Instructions match implementation
- **Simplicity**: Easier onboarding for new users
- **Reliability**: Correct workflow guidance

## Testing Checklist

After implementing fixes:
- [ ] No references to worktrees remain
- [ ] All version numbers are consistent (6.2.0-simplified)
- [ ] File paths match current structure
- [ ] Instance instructions are clear about root directory operation
- [ ] Workflow descriptions match instance_instructions/
- [ ] README.md remains aligned with updates

## Conclusion

The documentation requires significant updates to align with the simplified TeamOps v6.2 architecture. The primary focus should be on `tmops_claude_code.md` as it contains the most critical misalignments. Once updated, the framework documentation will accurately reflect the streamlined, worktree-free implementation that makes TeamOps more accessible and easier to use.

## Files Requiring Updates

1. `tmops_v6_portable/docs/tmops_docs_v6/tmops_claude_code.md` - **CRITICAL**
2. `tmops_v6_portable/docs/tmops_docs_v6/tmops_protocol.md` - **MEDIUM**
3. `tmops_v6_portable/docs/tmops_docs_v6/tmops_claude_chat.md` - **MEDIUM**
