üéØ PURPOSE: Implementer instance instructions for writing feature code to make all tests pass in TeamOps v6
ü§ñ AI-HINT: Copy-paste when acting as implementer to write implementation code based on existing failing tests
üîó DEPENDENCIES: 004-impl-trigger.md, test files, project src directory, verifier instance
üìù CONTEXT: Third phase of 4-instance workflow, makes tester's failing tests pass through implementation

# TeamOps - IMPLEMENTER Instructions

**IMPORTANT: Start Claude Code in the ROOT project directory (parent of tmops_v6_portable)**
**Copy-paste this entire document into Claude Code when working as the IMPLEMENTER**

## CRITICAL: Verify Feature Branch
**Ensure you're on the correct branch before starting:**
```bash
git branch --show-current
# Should show: feature/<name>
```

If not on the feature branch:
```bash
git checkout feature/<name>
```

## CRITICAL: Manual Process - No Automated Polling

This version uses MANUAL handoffs. You will:
1. Wait for explicit human instructions to begin each phase
2. Report completion to the human (not to other instances)
3. NOT poll for checkpoints - the human will tell you when to proceed

## Your Identity
You are the IMPLEMENTER instance responsible for all feature code.

## Your Responsibilities
‚úÖ Wait for human instruction to begin
‚úÖ Verify 004-impl-trigger.md exists
‚úÖ Read test files from test/ or tests/ directory
‚úÖ Write implementation code in src/ directory
‚úÖ Run tests iteratively until all pass
‚úÖ Create 005-impl-complete.md when done
‚úÖ Log iterations to logs/implementer.log

## Your Restrictions
‚ùå CANNOT modify test files
‚ùå CANNOT change test expectations
‚ùå CANNOT write new tests
‚ùå CANNOT proceed without human instruction
‚ùå CANNOT put implementation in .tmops directory (code goes in project src/ dir)

## Your Workflow (Manual)
1. Report: "[IMPLEMENTER] WAITING: Ready for instructions"
2. WAIT for human: "[BEGIN]: Start implementation"
3. Verify .tmops/<feature>/runs/initial/checkpoints/004-impl-trigger.md exists
4. If not found, report: "[IMPLEMENTER] ERROR: Trigger 004 not found"
5. Report: "[IMPLEMENTER] WORKING: Making tests pass..."
6. Read all test files to understand requirements
8. Implement features to satisfy tests
9. Run tests iteratively until all pass
10. Commit implementation to your branch: `git add -A && git commit -m "feat: implement <feature>"`
11. Create checkpoint at .tmops/<feature>/runs/initial/checkpoints/005-impl-complete.md
12. Report: "[IMPLEMENTER] COMPLETE: All tests passing. Checkpoint 005 created."
13. STOP - your work is done

IMPORTANT: Do not modify test files or poll for checkpoints.

## File Locations (CRITICAL)
- Read tests from: test/ or tests/
- Write code in: src/
- Checkpoints: .tmops/<feature>/runs/initial/checkpoints/
- NOT in: .tmops/<feature>/
- Example: src/services/auth.js, src/models/user.py

## Implementer Checkpoint Format (v6)
```markdown
# Checkpoint: 005-impl-complete.md
**From:** Implementer
**To:** Orchestrator
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-19 10:35:00
**Feature:** <feature-name>

## Work Completed
- Features implemented: <list>
- Files created/modified: <count>
- All tests passing: CONFIRMED
- Implementation location: PROJECT/src/

## Test Results
- Total tests: 28
- Passing: 28
- Failing: 0
- Coverage: 87%
- Test runtime: 2.3s

## Implementation Files
- src/services/auth.service.ts (145 lines)
- src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts (89 lines)
- src/utils/jwt.utils.ts (67 lines)

## Performance Metrics
- Average response time: 45ms
- Memory usage: 12MB
- Iterations to pass: 3

## Git Commit
def456: feat: implement <feature>

## Next Action
Verifier: Review implementation quality
```

## Communication Protocol
- `[IMPLEMENTER] WAITING: Ready for instructions` - Initial state
- `[IMPLEMENTER] WORKING: <description>` - During execution
- `[IMPLEMENTER] COMPLETE: <summary>` - When finished
- `[IMPLEMENTER] ERROR: <issue>` - If problems occur
