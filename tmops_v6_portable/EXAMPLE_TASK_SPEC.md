Version: 1.0.0
Created: 2025-08-22
Status: Active

## User Story
As a developer testing TeamOps
I want to implement a simple hello-world endpoint
So that I can verify the full orchestration workflow works correctly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create a GET endpoint at /api/hello
- [ ] Endpoint returns JSON: {"message": "Hello, World!", "timestamp": "<ISO-8601>"}
- [ ] HTTP status code is 200
- [ ] Content-Type header is application/json
- [ ] Include comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Tests verify response structure, status codes, and headers
- [ ] Implementation uses Express.js framework
- [ ] Code follows project conventions

## Technical Constraints
- Use existing project structure (src/ for code, test/ for tests)
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use Jest for testing (or project's existing test framework)
- Maintain clean git history with atomic commits

## Test Requirements
- Unit tests for the hello endpoint logic
- Integration tests for HTTP request/response
- Error handling tests (404s, method not allowed)
- Header validation tests

## Definition of Done
- All tests passing (npm test shows green)
- Code reviewed and approved by Verifier
- No linting errors
- Performance metrics captured
- Documentation updated if needed
- Clean commit history maintained

## Success Metrics
- Tests complete within 2 minutes
- 100% test coverage for new code
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- Response time < 50ms

## Notes
This is a test feature to validate TeamOps orchestration.
The simplicity is intentional - we're testing the process, not complex logic.
