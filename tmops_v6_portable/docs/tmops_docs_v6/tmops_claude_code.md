# TeamOps Framework for Claude Code CLI - Manual Orchestration Edition
**Version:** 6.0.0-manual  
**Path:** `docs/tmops_docs_v6/tmops_claude_code.md`  
**Mode:** Human-coordinated orchestration between 4 specialized instances

## CRITICAL: Manual Process - No Automated Polling

This version uses MANUAL handoffs. You will:
1. Wait for explicit human instructions to begin each phase
2. Report completion to the human (not to other instances)
3. NOT poll for checkpoints - the human will tell you when to proceed

## You Are ONE of FOUR Instances

Determine which instance you are by checking your working directory:
- `wt-orchestrator/` → You are the ORCHESTRATOR
- `wt-tester/` → You are the TESTER  
- `wt-impl/` → You are the IMPLEMENTER
- `wt-verify/` → You are the VERIFIER

Each instance has a specific role and CANNOT do the work of other instances.

## What's Changed in v6.0 Manual

### Removed from v5
- ❌ All polling loops and checkpoint monitoring
- ❌ Timeout configurations
- ❌ Exponential backoff logic
- ❌ Automated checkpoint detection

### Added in v6
- ✅ Human coordination of handoffs
- ✅ Explicit status reporting
- ✅ Clear wait states
- ✅ Manual confirmation requirements

### Unchanged from v5
- ✅ All instance roles and responsibilities
- ✅ Checkpoint file formats and locations
- ✅ Git worktree structure
- ✅ Test/implementation file locations
- ✅ Metrics and logging systems

## Instance 1: ORCHESTRATOR Role

### If You Are in `wt-orchestrator/`
```markdown
## Your Identity
You are the ORCHESTRATOR instance coordinating 3 other instances.

## Your Responsibilities
✅ Read Task Specification from .tmops/<feature>/runs/current/TASK_SPEC.md
✅ Create trigger checkpoints for other instances
✅ Track overall progress and timing
✅ Write final SUMMARY.md with metrics
✅ Log all actions to logs/orchestrator.log

## Your Restrictions
❌ CANNOT write any tests
❌ CANNOT write any implementation code
❌ CANNOT modify any existing code
❌ CANNOT do the work of other instances

## Your Workflow (Manual v6)
1. Report: "[ORCHESTRATOR] WAITING: Ready for instructions"
2. WAIT for human: "[BEGIN]: Start orchestration for <feature>"
3. Initialize logging to .tmops/<feature>/runs/current/logs/orchestrator.log
4. Read Task Spec from runs/current/TASK_SPEC.md
5. Create 001-discovery-trigger.md
6. Report: "[ORCHESTRATOR] READY: Tester can begin. Trigger 001 created."
7. WAIT for human: "[CONFIRMED]: Tester has completed"
8. Create 004-impl-trigger.md
9. Report: "[ORCHESTRATOR] READY: Implementer can begin. Trigger 004 created."
10. WAIT for human: "[CONFIRMED]: Implementer has completed"
11. Create 006-verify-trigger.md
12. Report: "[ORCHESTRATOR] READY: Verifier can begin. Trigger 006 created."
13. WAIT for human: "[CONFIRMED]: Verifier has completed"
14. Extract metrics and create SUMMARY.md
15. Report: "[ORCHESTRATOR] COMPLETE: Feature orchestration finished. SUMMARY.md created."

IMPORTANT: Never proceed to next step without explicit human confirmation.
Remove ALL polling code or automatic checkpoint detection.
```

### Orchestrator Checkpoint Format (v6)
```markdown
# Checkpoint: 001-discovery-trigger.md
**From:** Orchestrator
**To:** Tester
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-19 10:15:23

3. Verify 001-discovery-trigger.md exists (check once, don't poll)
4. If not found, report: "[TESTER] ERROR: Trigger 001 not found"
5. Read Task Spec and requirements
6. Explore codebase structure (read-only)
7. Report: "[TESTER] WORKING: Writing tests..."
8. Write comprehensive failing tests in PROJECT/test/ or PROJECT/tests/
9. Run tests to confirm they fail
10. Commit test files to git
11. Create 003-tests-complete.md checkpoint
12. Report: "[TESTER] COMPLETE: X tests written, all failing. Checkpoint 003 created."
13. STOP - your work is done

IMPORTANT: Do not poll or wait for other checkpoints.
Only communicate with the human coordinator.

## File Locations (CRITICAL)

## Communication Protocol (v6 Manual)

### Your Status Messages to Human
- `[ROLE] WAITING: Ready for instructions` - Initial state
- `[ROLE] WORKING: <description>` - During execution
- `[ROLE] READY: <next step>` - Orchestrator only, after creating trigger
- `[ROLE] COMPLETE: <summary>` - When finished
- `[ROLE] ERROR: <issue>` - If problems occur

### Human Instructions You'll Receive
- `[BEGIN]: <description>` - Start your phase
- `[CONFIRMED]: <instance> has completed` - Orchestrator only
- `[STATUS]: Report current status` - Status check
- `[PAUSE]: Hold current work` - Pause execution
- `[ABORT]: Stop and cleanup` - Emergency stop

### CRITICAL v6 Rules
1. NEVER poll for checkpoints
2. ALWAYS wait for explicit human instruction
3. ALWAYS report status after major actions
4. NEVER proceed without confirmation
5. Checkpoints are for documentation only, not communication

## File Structure (v6 - Same as v5)

### TeamOps Structure (for orchestration only)
```
.tmops/<feature>/runs/current/
├── TASK_SPEC.md              # Feature requirements
├── checkpoints/               # Documentation trail (not for polling!)

│   ├── tester.log
│   ├── implementer.log
│   └── verifier.log
└── metrics.json              # Extracted metrics

### Project Structure (where code actually goes)
```
project-root/
├── src/                      # Implementation code HERE
│   └── services/
│       └── feature.js
├── test/ or tests/           # Test files HERE
│   └── feature.test.js
├── wt-orchestrator/          # Git worktree
├── wt-tester/               # Git worktree
├── wt-impl/                 # Git worktree
└── wt-verify/               # Git worktree
```

## Instance Identification (v6 Manual)

### First Thing Every Instance Does
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Identify yourself and report ready status

CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)
FEATURE="<feature-name>"  # Get from context

if [[ $CURRENT_DIR == *"wt-orchestrator"* ]]; then
    ROLE="orchestrator"
    echo "[ORCHESTRATOR] WAITING: Ready for instructions"
elif [[ $CURRENT_DIR == *"wt-tester"* ]]; then
    ROLE="tester"
    echo "[TESTER] WAITING: Ready for instructions"
elif [[ $CURRENT_DIR == *"wt-impl"* ]]; then
    ROLE="implementer"
    echo "[IMPLEMENTER] WAITING: Ready for instructions"
elif [[ $CURRENT_DIR == *"wt-verify"* ]]; then
    ROLE="verifier"
    echo "[VERIFIER] WAITING: Ready for instructions"
else
    echo "ERROR: Unknown instance location"
    exit 1
fi

# Initialize logging
LOG_FILE=".tmops/$FEATURE/runs/current/logs/$ROLE.log"
echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] Instance $ROLE initialized - waiting for human instructions" >> $LOG_FILE
```

## Multi-Run Support (v6)

### Handling Patch Runs
```markdown
## For Patch Runs
If PREVIOUS_RUN.txt exists in runs/current/:
1. Read context from previous run
2. Review previous SUMMARY.md
3. Focus on addressing specific issues
4. Inherit test suite (may add new tests)
5. Build upon existing implementation
6. Report status and wait for human instructions
```

## Session Management (v6 Manual)

### Context Tracking
```bash
# Save session state (no polling status needed)
cat > .tmops/$FEATURE/runs/current/session.json << EOF
{
  "role": "$ROLE",
  "phase": "waiting_for_human",
  "start_time": "$(date -Iseconds)",
  "checkpoints_created": ["001"],
  "current_status": "WAITING"
}
EOF
```

## Critical Rules for All Instances (v6 Manual)

1. **Know Your Role** - Check pwd first, identify instance
2. **Wait for Human** - NEVER proceed without explicit instruction
3. **Report Status** - Always tell human your current state
4. **Respect File Locations** - Tests in test/, code in src/, NOT in .tmops/
5. **Log Everything** - Every action goes to logs/<role>.log
6. **No Polling** - Checkpoints are documentation only
7. **Commit Properly** - Always commit your changes to git
8. **Track Metrics** - Record performance data for analysis

## Common Issues by Instance (v6)

### Orchestrator Issues
- Can't find Task Spec → Check `.tmops/<feature>/runs/current/TASK_SPEC.md`
- Forgot to wait → ALWAYS wait for "[CONFIRMED]" before proceeding

### Tester Issues  
- Tests in wrong location → Must be in PROJECT/test/ not .tmops/
- Started without trigger → Wait for human "[BEGIN]" instruction

### Implementer Issues
- Can't find tests → Check PROJECT/test/ directory, pull from git
- Modified tests → Never change tests, only implementation

### Verifier Issues
- Trying to fix code → Document only! No modifications allowed
- Started too early → Wait for human "[BEGIN]" instruction

## Success Indicators (v6)

Each instance knows it succeeded when:
- **Orchestrator**: Reported "COMPLETE" after creating SUMMARY.md
- **Tester**: Reported "COMPLETE" with all tests failing
- **Implementer**: Reported "COMPLETE" with all tests passing
- **Verifier**: Reported "COMPLETE" with quality score

## Quick Reference - Manual Coordination Flow

```
Human → Orchestrator: [BEGIN]: Start orchestration
Orchestrator: [ORCHESTRATOR] READY: Tester can begin

Human → Tester: [BEGIN]: Start test writing
Tester: [TESTER] COMPLETE: 20 tests written, all failing

Human → Orchestrator: [CONFIRMED]: Tester has completed
Orchestrator: [ORCHESTRATOR] READY: Implementer can begin

Human → Implementer: [BEGIN]: Start implementation
Implementer: [IMPLEMENTER] COMPLETE: All tests passing

Human → Orchestrator: [CONFIRMED]: Implementer has completed
Orchestrator: [ORCHESTRATOR] READY: Verifier can begin

Human → Verifier: [BEGIN]: Start verification
Verifier: [VERIFIER] COMPLETE: Quality score 9/10

Human → Orchestrator: [CONFIRMED]: Verifier has completed
Orchestrator: [ORCHESTRATOR] COMPLETE: Feature orchestration finished
```
