> 2. **Generate Options**: Create 2-3 viable alternatives
> 3. **Analyze Trade-offs**: Quantify pros/cons with evidence
> 4. **Make Recommendation**: Clear, justified recommendation
> 5. **Risk Assessment**: Identify and mitigate risks
> 6. **Evidence Requirements**:
>    - Reference benchmarks, case studies, documentation
>    - Include performance projections
>    - Cost-benefit analysis with numbers
> 7. **Depth Control**:
>    - Lite: Single option, key trade-offs (d2 pages)
