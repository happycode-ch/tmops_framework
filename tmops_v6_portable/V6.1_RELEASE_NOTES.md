# TeamOps v6.1 Release Notes

**Version:** 6.1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Production Ready ‚úÖ

## üéØ Overview

TeamOps v6.1 transforms the framework from a single-feature prototype into a production-ready multi-feature orchestration system with comprehensive safety mechanisms.

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

### 1. Critical Safety Fixes
- **REMOVED** dangerous hardcoded `*hello*` patterns that could delete unrelated files
- Fixed in `cleanup_feature.sh` lines 94 and 105
- Prevents accidental deletion of files like `hello_world.js`, `shell_output.txt`, etc.

### 2. Multi-Feature Support
- **NEW** `init_feature_multi.sh` - Create multiple features simultaneously
  - Namespaced worktrees: `wt-{feature}-{role}` pattern
  - Feature name validation (3-20 chars, lowercase/numbers/hyphens only)
  - Automatic TASK_SPEC.md generation
  - Conflict detection with old v6.0 worktrees

- **NEW** `list_features.sh` - Show all active and archived features
  - Visual status display with Unicode formatting
  - Checkpoint counting per feature
  - Quick command reference

- **NEW** `switch_feature.sh` - Quick feature context switching
  - Shows worktree paths for specific feature
  - Displays checkpoint status
  - Helpful error messages

### 3. Safe Cleanup System
- **NEW** `cleanup_safe.sh` - Two-tier cleanup with extensive safety
  - `safe` mode: Only removes .tmops and worktrees
  - `full` mode: Also removes test/src files (with confirmation)
  - Automatic backup creation before any deletion
  - Uncommitted changes detection
  - Unpushed commits warning
  - Archive system for completed features
  - Color-coded output with clear warnings

### 4. Documentation Consolidation
- **NEW** Single `README.md` - Complete replacement for 5 old files
  - 705 lines reduced to 135 lines
  - Clear entry point with progressive disclosure
  - Quick start in 3 minutes
  - Multi-feature workflow examples

- **ARCHIVED** Old documentation to `.archive/v6.0-docs/`:
  - COPY_PASTE_GUIDE.md
  - PORTABLE_SUMMARY.md
  - README_QUICK_START.md
  - TEST_HELLO.md

### 5. Migration & Testing
- **NEW** `migrate_to_v6.1.sh` - Safe migration from v6.0
  - Detects old worktrees
  - Creates backups
  - Updates structure

- **NEW** `test_v6.1.sh` - Automated validation suite
  - Tests multi-feature creation
  - Validates safe cleanup
  - Ensures feature isolation

## üìä Key Metrics

| Metric | v6.0 | v6.1 | Improvement |

## üöÄ How to Use v6.1

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install
./INSTALL.sh

# Create multiple features
./tmops_tools/init_feature_multi.sh auth-api
./tmops_tools/init_feature_multi.sh payment-flow

# List all features
