# Summary: Answers to Your 3 Critical Questions

## 1. Multiple Features & Branches
**Current Problem:** Only ONE feature can be active at a time. If you run `init_feature_v6.sh api` then `init_feature_v6.sh auth`, the first feature's worktrees get destroyed.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Use namespaced worktrees: `wt-api-orchestrator`, `wt-auth-tester`, etc.
- New structure: `.tmops/active/` for current features, `.tmops/archived/` for completed ones
- New commands: `switch_feature.sh`, `list_features.sh`, `archive_feature.sh`

## 2. Cleanup Feature Dangers
**Current DANGER:** YES - cleanup_feature.sh is dangerous!
- Hardcoded search for "*hello*" could delete ANY file with "hello" in the name
- Force-deletes git branches without checking for unpushed commits
- No backup mechanism

**Proposed Fix:**
- Two scripts: `cleanup_test_feature.sh` (safe) and `cleanup_production_feature.sh` (full)
- Remove ALL hardcoded patterns
- Add backup before any deletion
- Require explicit confirmation with feature name typing

## 3. Portable Package Match
**Current Status:** NO - the portable package is missing critical safety updates

**Issues Found:**
- Portable version has the same dangerous cleanup script
- Documentation is fragmented (5 different README-like files)
- No clear starting point for developers

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Single README.md entry point
- Simplified structure: `tmops/`, `roles/`, `examples/`
- Include ONLY safe versions of scripts
- Progressive disclosure (basic → examples → deep docs)

## Critical Action Items
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Remove hardcoded "hello" patterns from cleanup script
2. **URGENT:** Implement backup mechanism before any deletions
3. **IMPORTANT:** Add multi-feature support with namespaced worktrees
