## Repository Description (Short)
TeamOps Framework - Orchestration protocol for coordinating multiple AI instances in software development workflows

## Repository Description (Full)
TeamOps is a sophisticated orchestration framework that enables multiple Claude AI instances to collaborate on software development tasks. Using a checkpoint-based communication protocol and specialized role separation (Orchestrator, Tester, Implementer, Verifier), TeamOps implements test-driven development workflows with built-in quality gates. Perfect for complex feature development, automated testing, and learning AI orchestration patterns.
