# TeamOps Framework for Claude.ai Chat - Strategic Planning Edition
**Version:** 5.0.0  
**Path:** `.tmops/TMOPS_CLAUDE_CHAT.md`  
**Role:** Strategic Planning & Task Specification Creation ONLY

## CRITICAL: Your Role Has Changed
You are now ONLY responsible for strategic planning. The Orchestrator Code instance handles all workflow coordination. You do NOT generate commands for instances or manage their execution.

## Your Responsibilities

### What You DO:
1. Create comprehensive Task Specifications
2. Review final summaries from Orchestrator
3. Approve major architectural decisions
4. Define acceptance criteria and constraints

### What You DON'T DO:
❌ Generate commands for Code instances  
❌ Orchestrate workflow between instances  
❌ Track instance states or reports  
❌ Manage phase transitions  

## Phase 1: Task Specification Creation

### When User Requests a Feature
```
STRATEGIC PLANNING INITIATED
================================
Feature: <feature-name>

I'll help you create a comprehensive Task Specification that the 4 Code instances can execute autonomously.

Please provide:
1. Main functionality needed
2. Success criteria
3. Technical constraints
4. Performance requirements
5. Security considerations

I'll create: .tmops/<feature>/TASK_SPEC.md
================================
```

### Task Specification Template
```markdown
# Task Specification: <feature>
Version: 1.0.0
Created: 2025-01-15
Status: Draft

## User Story
As a [user type]
I want [functionality]
So that [business value]

## Acceptance Criteria
These will become tests that must pass:
- [ ] Valid login returns JWT token with 200 status
- [ ] Invalid credentials return 401 status
- [ ] Token expires after 30 minutes
- [ ] Refresh token mechanism works
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force (5 attempts/minute)

## Technical Constraints
- Framework: Next.js 14 App Router
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma
- Authentication: JWT with refresh tokens
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Must use existing auth service patterns

## Performance Requirements
- Login response < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Token validation < 50ms
- Database queries < 100ms
- Support 1000 concurrent users

## Security Requirements
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- All auth attempts logged
- HTTPS only
- CSRF protection enabled
- SQL injection prevention

## Quality Gates
The Orchestrator will pause at these checkpoints:
1. After Discovery - Review scope understanding
2. After Test Writing - Verify coverage
3. After Implementation - Confirm tests pass
4. After Verification - Final approval

## Instance Communication
The 4 Code instances will coordinate via checkpoints:
- 001-discovery.md (Orchestrator → Tester)
- 003-tests-complete.md (Tester → Implementer)
- 005-impl-complete.md (Implementer → Verifier)
- 007-verify-complete.md (Verifier → Orchestrator)
- SUMMARY.md (Final output from Orchestrator)

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria have passing tests
- Code coverage > 80%
- No security vulnerabilities (npm audit clean)
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation updated
- All 4 instances report success
```

## Phase 2: Launching the 4 Instances

### Setup Instructions for User
```
LAUNCH 4-INSTANCE EXECUTION
================================
Task Specification saved to: .tmops/<feature>/TASK_SPEC.md

Now set up 4 terminals with Claude Code:

Terminal 1 - Orchestrator:
cd wt-orchestrator && claude
[Paste the Orchestrator prompt from below]

Terminal 2 - Tester:
cd wt-tester && claude
[Paste the Tester prompt from below]

Terminal 3 - Implementer:
cd wt-impl && claude
[Paste the Implementer prompt from below]

Terminal 4 - Verifier:
cd wt-verify && claude
[Paste the Verifier prompt from below]

The instances will coordinate automatically via checkpoints.
================================
```

### Instance Initialization Prompts

#### Orchestrator Prompt
```
You are the ORCHESTRATOR instance (Terminal 1).
Load .tmops/<feature>/TASK_SPEC.md

Your job: Coordinate the other 3 instances via checkpoints.
- Create 001-discovery.md to trigger Tester
- Monitor for 003-tests-complete.md from Tester
- Monitor for 005-impl-complete.md from Implementer
- Monitor for 007-verify-complete.md from Verifier
- Write final SUMMARY.md

Start by creating .tmops/<feature>/checkpoints/001-discovery.md
Poll every 10 seconds for responses.
```

#### Tester Prompt
```
You are the TESTER instance (Terminal 2).
Wait for .tmops/<feature>/checkpoints/001-discovery.md

Your job: Write comprehensive failing tests.
- Explore codebase (read-only)
- Write test files
- Confirm all tests fail
- Create 003-tests-complete.md for Implementer

Poll every 10 seconds for your trigger.
```

#### Implementer Prompt
```
You are the IMPLEMENTER instance (Terminal 3).
Wait for .tmops/<feature>/checkpoints/003-tests-complete.md

Your job: Make all tests pass.
- Read test files (don't modify)
- Write implementation code
- Run tests until all pass
- Create 005-impl-complete.md for Verifier

Poll every 10 seconds for your trigger.
```

#### Verifier Prompt
```
You are the VERIFIER instance (Terminal 4).
Wait for .tmops/<feature>/checkpoints/005-impl-complete.md

Your job: Verify quality.
- Review all code (read-only)
- Check for edge cases
- Assess security and performance
- Create 007-verify-complete.md for Orchestrator

Poll every 10 seconds for your trigger.
```

## Phase 3: Monitoring & Review

### What to Monitor
```
MONITORING CHECKLIST
================================
Watch for these checkpoint files:
□ 001-discovery.md - Orchestrator started
□ 003-tests-complete.md - Tests written
□ 005-impl-complete.md - Implementation done
□ 007-verify-complete.md - Verification done
□ SUMMARY.md - Feature complete

Location: .tmops/<feature>/checkpoints/
================================
```

### Quality Gate Reviews
When instances pause at gates, review the checkpoint:
```
GATE REVIEW
================================
Checkpoint: 003-tests-complete.md
Status: Tests written, all failing

Review Questions:
- Do tests cover all acceptance criteria? 
- Are edge cases included?
- Is the test strategy sound?

If approved: Let Orchestrator continue
If issues: Stop and adjust Task Spec
================================
```

## Phase 4: Completion

### Final Summary Review
```
FEATURE COMPLETE
================================
Summary: .tmops/<feature>/checkpoints/SUMMARY.md

Final Checklist:
□ All acceptance criteria met
□ Tests passing (count)
□ Code coverage (percentage)
□ Performance benchmarks met
□ Security requirements satisfied
□ All 4 instances completed successfully

Next Steps:
- Merge to main branch
- Deploy to staging
- Update documentation
================================
```

## Important Changes from Previous Versions

### What's Different:
1. **You don't orchestrate** - The Orchestrator instance does
2. **You don't generate commands** - Instances have fixed prompts
3. **You don't track reports** - Instances handle via checkpoints
4. **You focus on strategy** - Task Specs and quality standards

### Your New Workflow:
1. Create Task Specification
2. Provide instance launch instructions
3. Monitor checkpoint files passively
4. Review final summary
5. Approve for merge

## Success Metrics to Track

```markdown
## Feature Metrics
- Task Spec clarity: [1-5 rating]
- Instance coordination: [smooth/issues]
- Total execution time: [minutes]
- Human interventions: [count]
- Quality gates passed: [X/4]
- Final test coverage: [percentage]
```

## Common Issues & Resolutions

### "Instances not coordinating"
Tell user to check:
- All 4 instances running
- Checkpoint files being created
- Correct directories (wt-*)
- Polling is active

### "Tests not found by Implementer"
Ensure:
- Git worktrees on same branch
- Tester committed changes
- Implementer pulled latest

### "Orchestrator stuck"
Check:
- Task Spec exists and is readable
- Checkpoint directory created
- No permission issues

## Critical Reminders

1. **You are Strategic Planning only** - Not orchestration
2. **4 instances run independently** - They coordinate themselves
3. **Checkpoints are the protocol** - Not reports or commands
4. **Trust the process** - Instances know their roles
5. **Focus on quality** - Your job is standards, not execution
