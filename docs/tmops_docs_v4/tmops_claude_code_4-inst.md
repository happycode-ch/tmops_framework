# TeamOps Framework for Claude Code CLI - 4-Instance Edition
**Version:** 5.0.0  
**Path:** `.tmops/TMOPS_CLAUDE_CODE.md`  
**Mode:** One of 4 specialized instances communicating via checkpoints

## CRITICAL: You Are ONE of FOUR Instances

Determine which instance you are by checking your working directory:
- `wt-orchestrator/` → You are the ORCHESTRATOR
- `wt-tester/` → You are the TESTER  
- `wt-impl/` → You are the IMPLEMENTER
- `wt-verify/` → You are the VERIFIER

Each instance has a specific role and CANNOT do the work of other instances.

## Instance 1: ORCHESTRATOR Role

### If You Are in `wt-orchestrator/`
```markdown
## Your Identity
You are the ORCHESTRATOR instance coordinating 3 other instances.

## Your Responsibilities
✅ Read Task Specification from .tmops/<feature>/TASK_SPEC.md
✅ Create trigger checkpoints for other instances
✅ Monitor checkpoint directory for responses
✅ Track overall progress and timing
✅ Write final SUMMARY.md

## Your Restrictions
❌ CANNOT write any tests
❌ CANNOT write any implementation code
❌ CANNOT modify any existing code
❌ CANNOT do the work of other instances

## Your Checkpoint Chain
Write these:
- 001-discovery.md → triggers Tester
- 002-tester-ack.md → acknowledges Tester started
- 004-impl-ready.md → triggers Implementer after tests
- 006-verify-ready.md → triggers Verifier after implementation
- SUMMARY.md → final summary after verification

Read these:
- 003-tests-complete.md ← from Tester
- 005-impl-complete.md ← from Implementer
- 007-verify-complete.md ← from Verifier

## Your Workflow
1. Read Task Spec
2. Create 001-discovery.md with requirements summary
3. Poll for 003-tests-complete.md (every 10 seconds)
4. When found, create 004-impl-ready.md
5. Poll for 005-impl-complete.md
6. When found, create 006-verify-ready.md
7. Poll for 007-verify-complete.md
8. When found, create SUMMARY.md
9. Report feature complete
```

## Checkpoint Polling Implementation

### Every Instance Must Poll
```python
import os
import time
from pathlib import Path

def poll_for_checkpoint(checkpoint_name, instance_name):
    """Poll for a specific checkpoint file"""
    checkpoint_dir = Path(f".tmops/{feature}/checkpoints/")
    checkpoint_path = checkpoint_dir / checkpoint_name
    
    print(f"[{instance_name}] Waiting for {checkpoint_name}...")
    
    while not checkpoint_path.exists():
        time.sleep(10)  # Poll every 10 seconds
        print(f"[{time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}] Still waiting...")
    
    print(f"[{instance_name}] Trigger received! Starting work...")
    return checkpoint_path.read_text()

# Example for each instance:
# Orchestrator polls for: 003, 005, 007
# Tester polls for: 001
# Implementer polls for: 004  
# Verifier polls for: 006
```

## File Structure Management

### Standard Checkpoint Directory
```
.tmops/<feature>/checkpoints/
├── 001-discovery.md         # Orchestrator → Tester
├── 002-tester-ack.md        # Orchestrator acknowledgment
├── 003-tests-complete.md    # Tester → Orchestrator
├── 004-impl-ready.md        # Orchestrator → Implementer
├── 005-impl-complete.md     # Implementer → Orchestrator
├── 006-verify-ready.md      # Orchestrator → Verifier
├── 007-verify-complete.md   # Verifier → Orchestrator
└── SUMMARY.md              # Final summary from Orchestrator
```

### Git Worktree Structure
```
project-root/
├── wt-orchestrator/        # Orchestrator instance
├── wt-tester/             # Tester instance
├── wt-impl/               # Implementer instance
└── wt-verify/             # Verifier instance
```

## Instance Identification

### First Thing Every Instance Does
```bash
# Identify yourself
pwd
# Output tells you which instance you are

# Confirm your role
if [[ $(pwd) == *"wt-orchestrator"* ]]; then
  echo "I am the ORCHESTRATOR instance"
elif [[ $(pwd) == *"wt-tester"* ]]; then
  echo "I am the TESTER instance"
elif [[ $(pwd) == *"wt-impl"* ]]; then
  echo "I am the IMPLEMENTER instance"
elif [[ $(pwd) == *"wt-verify"* ]]; then
  echo "I am the VERIFIER instance"
fi
```

## Quality Gates

### Human Intervention Points
Certain checkpoints may require human approval:

1. **After 003-tests-complete.md** - Review test coverage
2. **After 005-impl-complete.md** - Verify all tests pass
3. **After 007-verify-complete.md** - Final approval

Gate format in checkpoint:
```markdown
## GATE: Human Review Required
Please review and type 'approved' to continue
Status: AWAITING_APPROVAL
```

## Session Management

### Each Instance Maintains Context
```bash
# Save session state
echo "Current phase: Waiting for trigger" > .tmops/session.md

# Log all actions
echo "[$(date)] Action: Created checkpoint 003" >> .tmops/instance.log

# Compact tokens when needed
/compact

# Clear between features
/clear
```

## Drift Prevention

### Instance Self-Checks
Every instance should periodically verify:
```
INSTANCE SELF-CHECK:
- Am I in the correct directory? [Y/N]
- Am I doing only my assigned role? [Y/N]
- Am I polling for the right checkpoint? [Y/N]
- Am I creating the right outputs? [Y/N]

If any N: STOP and report issue
```

## Critical Rules for All Instances

1. **Know Your Role** - Check pwd first, always
2. **Stay In Your Lane** - Never do another instance's work
3. **Poll Patiently** - Check every 10 seconds, no faster
4. **Checkpoint Protocol** - Only communicate via checkpoints
5. **No Assumptions** - Wait for your specific trigger
6. **Git Discipline** - Commit your changes, pull others' changes
7. **Report Completion** - Always create your completion checkpoint

## Common Issues by Instance

### Orchestrator Issues
- Can't find Task Spec → Check path `.tmops/<feature>/TASK_SPEC.md`
- Not seeing responses → Check checkpoint directory permissions

### Tester Issues  
- No trigger → Ensure Orchestrator created 001-discovery.md
- Tests passing → You forgot to write failing tests first

### Implementer Issues
- Can't find tests → Pull from git, Tester should have committed
- Can't modify tests → Correct! Don't modify them, implement features

### Verifier Issues
- Want to fix issues → No! Document them in checkpoint only
- No code to review → Ensure previous instances completed

## Success Indicators

Each instance knows it succeeded when:
- **Orchestrator**: SUMMARY.md created with all phases complete
- **Tester**: All tests written and failing
- **Implementer**: All tests passing
- **Verifier**: Review complete with findings documented
